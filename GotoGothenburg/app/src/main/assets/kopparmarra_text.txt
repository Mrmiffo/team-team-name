Kopparmärra is the name of the statue that you will find next to the stop Kungsportsplatsen. The status depicts King Karl the 9th (IX) and was erected in 1904, but as early as 1900 the citizens of Gothenburg could see a “test rider”, a 12meter wooden frame that was used to find the best spot. The statue is made of bronze and weighs some 6659kilos and the rider is 5.6meters high. The name comes from the famous “Gothenburg humor” (play with words) and in order to make fun of the statue it was called Kopparmärra, or Coppermare in english, as the horse the king is riding is a mare, or “Märr” in swedish and it looks like it’s made of copper, although it’s made of bronze.
