The district Landala is one of Gothenburgs three first workers-suburbs. The name is said to be traced back to the end of the 18th century and the owner Bengt Landin who was a coppersmith and a member of the swedish parliament. Documents from the end of the 19th century tell about Landala as a very poor neighborhood with houses spread in no particular order and of very low standard. In the 1870s the area was subjugated to city planning and the simple wooden houses were complemented with the typical “Landshövdingehus” or “Governor’s house”, the three story buildings with the ground floor made of brick and upper floors in wood. During 1964 - 1968 large parts of the 19th and 20th century buildings were demolished to be replaced by high-rise appartments during the 1970s development of  “Miljonprogrammet”, or the Million Programme.
