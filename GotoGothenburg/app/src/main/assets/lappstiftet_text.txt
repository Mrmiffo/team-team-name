LÃ¤ppstiftet or the Lipstick in english, is the local name for the distinct red and white striped skyscraper near the channel. This 86m tall building was constructed during 1986-89 and the aim was to create work places and stimulate the development in the region. It has since become a distinct part of the Gothenburg skyline.
